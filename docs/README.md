# Hyesky GEO documentation

Hyesky GEO is a self-hosted **GEO** (Generative Engine Optimization) radar. It asks AI search engines the kinds of questions a buyer would ask, then scores whether they **mention** your brand and **cite** your domain.

Keys stay on your server (BYOK). One admin password. No SaaS markup.

## What it measures

Each scan sends your **probes** to the engines you enable. Hyesky GEO stores every answer, then computes:

- **AI visibility** — share of *unprompted* answers that mention you
- **Citation rate** — share of those answers that link your official domain
- **Interception** — category/scenario probes that name a competitor instead of you
- **Average rank** — how early your domain appears in the citation list

Dashboard rates **exclude probes that already name your brand**, so repeating your name does not inflate the score.

## Engines

| UI name | Model (scan) | Search |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Perplexity | `sonar` | Built in |
| OpenAI | `gpt-4o` | Web search tool |
| Gemini | `gemini-3.6-flash` | Google Search grounding |
| DeepSeek | `deepseek-chat` | Provider search (when available) |
| Qwen | `qwen-plus` | Provider search (when available) |

You only pay the providers. Hyesky GEO never sees your keys in the browser after save.

## Status

MVP: one operator, many brands, no SSO or team roles. Fine for a laptop, a small VPS, or a Vercel hobby project.
